"""Delivery guarantees of the bridge — reproductions of the 2026-07-31 audit findings.

Every test here corresponds to one finding and is written DELIBERATELY so that it fails against
the code as it stood. Only then was the code fixed. The letters are the audit's own labels:

  A – an inbound message is lost when the write into tmux fails
  B – Telegram is told the update was handled before the message is safely stored
  C – a turn ended by silence bypasses the guard against an unanswered turn
  D – if the network fails mid-way through a long message, already delivered parts are re-sent
  F – attachments are not in the durable queue, so they are lost or land on the wrong reply
  K – state is not separated per bot, only by an environment variable

Background: messages were disappearing without a trace. A monitor was killing the bridge four
times a day, and finding B says every one of those kills could have eaten an arriving message
for good.
