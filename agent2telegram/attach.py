"""Attach mode — drive an existing live agent session, the way a hand-rolled bridge does.

Async model:
  * **inbound** (main thread): poll Telegram → inject each message into the live tmux session
    via send-keys. No blocking wait.
  * **outbound** (background thread): tail the agent transcript and, via an agent-specific
    :mod:`reader`, forward every assistant message of Telegram-originated turns, drive a live
    one-line tool-call status bubble, and detect end-of-turn (Codex: ``task_complete`` in the
    log; Claude Code: a marker its Stop hook writes; plus an idle fallback).
  * **typing** (background thread): assert "typing…" while a turn is in flight, independent of
    the send path so a flood-control sleep can't starve it.

This keeps the agent's full session (context, persona, tools) and adds Telegram I/O around it.
